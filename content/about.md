Hey there! I'm Pramod Choudhari from Kolhapur, India 🇮🇳.

## 🚀 Software Engineer

I love backend technologies, especially databases. Witnessing the evolution of smart solutions over the years is truly fascinating.

## 👣 Beyond Tech

When I'm not immersed in code, you'll find me exploring new places, going on treks, and maintaining a fit lifestyle 💪. But the best moments? That's quality time with friends and family 👨‍👩‍👧.

## 🌟 Learning Journey

As the saying goes, "Bunny, tum kitna bhi try karo, kuch na kuch toh choot jata hai." In the ever-evolving tech landscape, there's always an element of surprise and something new to learn.

Thanks for stopping by!
